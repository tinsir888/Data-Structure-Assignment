# NKU_CS_DataStructure_Assignment
In the third semester, undergraduates G2019 of College of Computer Science in Nankai University are supposed to select data structure according to the plan. I chose Prof. Xin's, so I'd like to share assignment she distributed. There are 6 assignments in total, related to Linked List, Huffman Coding, B-Tree, Depth First Search, Sorting Algorithms and Graph Theory respectively. These are some small and simple exercises.
